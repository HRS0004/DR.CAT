# TODO: Overhaul FooterSection.tsx

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. **[COMPLETE]** Update overall footer structure: Change from h-screen to appropriate height (e.g., min-h-[60vh]), retain top CTA, make main content a flex row with left, middle (empty for future logo), and right sections. Ensure bottom alignment for copyright and policies.

2. **[COMPLETE]** Restructure left section: Stack brand logo (Dr + DR.CAT), paragraph (text-gray-300), social icons (fix sizes to w-5 h-5, flex row), and copyright line (text-xs text-gray-300, single line with full text including license).

3. **[COMPLETE]** Restructure right section: Use flex or grid for 3 columns (Treatments, Support, Company) with headers (font-semibold text-sm) and links (text-gray-300 hover:text-white). Below columns, add policies line (text-xs text-gray-300, single line with | separators, right-aligned within right section).

4. **[COMPLETE]** Improve typography and spacing: Apply consistent padding (px-6 py-8), gaps (gap-6), higher contrast colors across secondary text/links. Add transitions to hovers.

5. **[COMPLETE]** Verify and test: Use browser_action to launch site, scroll to footer, check layout/balance/readability on desktop/mobile, close browser. Run lint if needed.

6. **[COMPLETE]** Mark complete and attempt_completion.
